As you know, the year 2025 has arrived, so itâ€™s possible that your autodate function may not work correctly with the data from 2023 and 2024. To practice effectively, you can use the latest data from 2024. Keep in mind that the data is only available up to November, which might not be fully valid in some cases. If possible, avoid displaying the year in certain areas to ensure accuracy.
